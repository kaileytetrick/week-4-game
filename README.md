Feed the Monkey!

An interactive game in which players try to match a random given number by clicking objects with hidden values. 

How It Works:

  There are four bananas displayed as buttons on the page.
  Players will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
  When the player clicks on a banana, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
  The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game and an alert is prompted.
  The player loses if their score goes above the random number and an alert is prompted.
  The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
  When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number and all bananas will have four new hidden values.
  The number of wins and losses will be tracked dynamically in the HTML for the player to see.
